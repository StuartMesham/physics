# Newtonian Physics
Inspired by some introductory physics lectures, here are two interactive simulations.

The first, ```bouncy_ball.py``` is a simulation of a ball that is elastic and is under the influence of gravity.
You can click and drag to throw the ball around.

The second, ```planets.py``` is a simulation of a few planets.
The planets have different masses and gravity acts between all of the planets.
You can click and drag to throw the planets around.
With some hand-eye coordination, you can also get the planets to orbit each other.

Be careful though, this square universe isn't infinite and the planets bounce off the sides.
